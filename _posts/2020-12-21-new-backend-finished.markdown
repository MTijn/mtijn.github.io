After a long while of inactivity, I was finally able to replace the back-end I had developed before.
<!--more-->

The one that I had developed before was part of a proof of concept of event sourcing, and had a lot more dependencies then I actually needed, for example the Axion Framework for event sourcing. Besides that it didn't have a back-end where I could enter new posts in.

So here I am with a new version, build with the latest Spring Boot, Kotlin and Freemarker as technologies. The front-end is still Angular, although I upgraded that to the latest version too.
