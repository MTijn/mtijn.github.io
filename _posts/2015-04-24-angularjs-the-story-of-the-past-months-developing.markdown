Since I read about the JavaScript frameworks I wanted to get myself acquainted with the techniques involved with them.

Before this I had mostly experience with PHP MVC frameworks that I had linked up with Smarty for the template engine. For my personal projects I was using Kohana to accomplish this. Sadly the Kohana team decided to stop all development on the framework, so I had to choose a new framework.

At that moment I also decided to look into the possibility to create a back-end and front-end mechanism whereby the two systems should be able to work independently from each other. At first I was looking at Cake 3, when still in beta, but I decided to go for Laravel as the API server to deliver content for my front-end.

Now I had an API to talk to, but still no front-end framework, so I looked at reviews between the frameworks and after a while I had two candidates, AngularJS and EmberJS. After doing the todoMVC I chose AngularJS for my front-end.

I must admin it had a steep learning curve, since coming from PHP frameworks, but after a while I got the hang of it. Since then most development went smoothly, and first all the functionality I wanted to have was created, and rewritten when I discovered a better way of doing things, when that process was finished I started on CSS and as you may see I used Bootstrap to do must of the grid, buttons and borders.

This process started in August of 2014, and finally I am at a point where I can release the first version of my rewritten site.
